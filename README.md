# code-for-lipid-bilayer-dynamic-and-sorting
The attached four scripts are commonly used for single molecule dynamic and sorting study in lipid bilayer. all scripts take place after video/Image being pocessed via ImageJ. All script attached are written by Zoe.

'plot_supper_res_voronio.m' plot the super resolution into voronio diagram with color present the density of the localizations.

'find_center_of_cropped_data.m' find the center of membrane curvature by fitting the extra localizations histogram at curvature location to a 2D gaussian function.

'Singlestep_daway_each_NP.m' are used after linking procedure. it finds the diffusion coefficients by fitting single step histogram to Rayleigh distribution.

'Study_diff_limit_intensity_vs_r.m' analysis the diffraction limited image paired with the nanoparticle location, it finds the center of membrane curvature and measures each curvatures intensity as a function of distance away from center.
